    "As a large grocery and goods retailer, it is always in your best interests to hold your inventory at optimal levels. Store managers look to reduce spoilage risk of over-stocking perishable goods, and also hope to avoid being out-of-stock of goods that are heavily demanded. These scenarios are stressed during times of severe weather, such as heavy rainfall or snowfall. Are the effects of weather large enough to change buying patterns of potentially weather sensitive goods (like milk, bread, umbrellas) at stores? Or are there other factors that are more influential to consumers when going to the store? In this case study, I will be testing to see if there is a relationship between sales of weather sensitive goods and weather, and will also be forecasting future sales using a predictive regression model. The aim of this case study is to help give store managers a better approach on handling inventory management during times of severe weather for their top selling items. These popular items account for most of each store's inventory and sales during over the course of each year, and therefore their inventories should be managed efficiently."
